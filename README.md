# BP-monitor
This application will help you maintain record of your blood pressure and show systematic graphs. I have used Tkinter for the GUI, I wanted to make a Web-based application, But that seems too hard with python rn. Might Update at a later stage. This application creates a database using MySQL and hence you can Input date, time, Systabolic and Diabolic Blood pressures measured at the time, as well as your pulse. After Inputting all details, You can click on the show graph button to show the ups-and-downs of your BP.

# Requirements:-
1) Tkinter
2) Matplotlib
3) Mysql (and Mysql.connector)

Hope you like it!
